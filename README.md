# Air Wisconsin Interview

This is the repository that I am sharing with Air Wisconsin that contains a website I co-built for a web development class in college

## How to compile and run

Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder with the code in it, then click run up on top and then click "run without debugging". It will open the website in a new chrome tab.

## Description

This is a website that I co-built for a class in a current class I am taking. The class is titled Web Systems and it is a web development based class. The website had a long list of criteria and every bit of the criteria was met. We were able to pick what we wanted to build our websites for, and we chose to target the custom PC building group of people on the internet because we felt there would be a lot of content that we could include with the website. It contains a consistent header, navbar and footer throughout all pages and then the content portion of each page is unique. The code contains all HTML and CSS currently, but the next project we will be doing in the class is to add some JavaScript and PHP functionality to it (which I am really excited about). I am very proud of this project because there is are a lot of different things going on with it and it all works together really well in my opinion.
